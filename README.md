This is intended to be my personal documentation for maintaining a [Plex](https://plex.tv) server â€“ my preferences for using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to encode files to manageable sizes, onboarding guides for users invited to the server, etc.

**If you've been invited to my Plex server**, please check out the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/tomhenrich/plex/wiki/Welcome-to-Plex).
