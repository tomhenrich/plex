This is intended to be my personal documentation for maintaining a [Plex](https://plex.tv) server â€“ my preferences for using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to encode files copied from my Blu-ray collection to manageable sizes, onboarding guides for users invited to the server, etc.

**If you've been invited to my Plex server**, please check out the [Welcome Guide](welcome-guide/README.md).
