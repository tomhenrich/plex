[Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) is a tool providing a wide variety of features for monitoring Plex.

It tracks viewership, displays graphs of activity, monitors uptime, and can be set up to send [notifications](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/wiki/Notification-Agents-Guide) based on any number of conditions.

I have Tautulli installed as part of [Home Assistant](https://github.com/tomhenrich/hass-config), rather than running on the same PC that hosts Plex.
