# Updating Your Quality Settings

It's important to update the quality settings in your Plex app(s) to make sure you get the best streaming experience. (And to reduce the strain on my server since it has to work harder otherwise.)

## iOS/Android App

1. Tap your profile icon in the top right corner of the app
2. Tap "Settings" then select "Video & Audio"
   * Local Quality: `Maximum`
   * Wi-Fi Quality: `Maximum`
   * Allow Direct Play: `On`
   * Allow Direct Stream: `On`

## Other Streaming Devices (Roku, Fire Stick, etc)

1. In the left-hand menu, select "Settings"
2. In the "Video" section:
   * "Auto Adjust Quality" (if present): `Off`
   * "Local Quality" and "Remote Quality": `Original`
   * "Allow Direct Play": `On`
   * "Allow Direct Stream": `On`

These may have different names depending on the platform â€” anywhere it asks for quality levels, set them to `Maximum` or `Original`.
