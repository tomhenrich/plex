# Welcome to Plex

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) is a company that makes software letting you host media files and stream that content to devices. Think of it like Netflix, but run by an individual from their own home.

1. [Getting Started](#getting-started): get logged in and update some basic settings
2. [Basic Intro](#basic-intro)
3. [Using Plex](#using-plex): start watching!

## Getting Started

Three quick steps:

1. From the invitation email you received, click the link to **create a Plex account** on the official Plex website.
2. **Install the Plex app** on [your streaming device of choice](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/) and sign in. [^1]
3. Set up your app:
   1. **[Update the quality settings](Guides/QualitySettings.md)** in your app. (The default settings are very low quality.)
   2. **[Save my content to your navigation](https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/#toc-0)** and remove their default streaming garbage.
      * This looks a little different on each device, but generally: open the navigation, select "More", find whatever I've shared with you (you'll see my server `Scylla`), and pin them for quick access.

That's it! You're in and can start looking for something to watch.

## Basic Intro
My Plex server is running from a computer in my home and has content I've personally curated. As such:

* **It's not meant to be a full replacement for every possible streaming subscription.**
  * I don't have the resources to acquire every movie ever made, but if there's something you'd like me to add, let me know and I'll do what I can to find it (within reason).
* **You may not share your account with anyone else.**

An analogy I like: **my server is like a backyard pool shared with friends.**
* You're welcome to use it whenever you like!
* Sometimes it might be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.
* Yes, I can tell if it's being used, mostly just to know if something needs to be fixed.
* Giving your key to someone else will get you kicked out.

## Using Plex
The **Home Screen** shows what has recently been added and anything you're in the middle of watching.

Plex is organized into **Libraries** that contain either Movies or TV Shows. You can browse a specific Library or you can use search. Franchises with multiple movies are condensed into **Collections** (e.g. all the James Bond movies).

Once you decide on something to watch, **just click Play**. You can change your settings at any time â€” enable subtitles, adjust streaming quality, or change audio tracks (if available).

> [!TIP]
> **Subtitles:** You can [update your account settings](Guides/AccountSettings.md) to enable subtitles without having to select them every time you start watching.

> [!NOTE]
> If you ever see ads, you're watching something from Plex's own service. You will _never_ see ads while watching anything from my server.
