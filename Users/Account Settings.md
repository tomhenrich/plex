# Account Settings
You can log into your Plex account on the web to update various settings. I recommend at least updating your language and subtitle settings.

## Subtitles
If you prefer having subtitles on, you can log into your account and set that preference instead of having to select them every time you watch something:

  1. [Log into your account on the web](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/login)
  2. Go to the [Settings page](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account)
  2. Under the "Language" tab, enable the checkbox for "Automatically select audio and subtitle tracks"
  3. Set your preferred languages
  4. Select "Always enabled" for "Auto-Select Subtitle Mode" and then set your preferred subtitle settings
  5. Select "Save Changes"
