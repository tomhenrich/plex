# Account Settings
You can log into your Plex account on the web to update various settings. I recommend at least updating your language and subtitle settings.

## Subtitles
If you prefer having subtitles on, you can log into your account and set that preference instead of having to select them every time you watch something:

  1. [log into your account on the web](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account) and go to the Settings page
  2. Under the "Language" tab, enable the checkbox for "Automatically select audio and subtitle tracks"
  3. Set your preferred languages
  4. Select "Always enabled" for "Auto-Select Subtitle Mode" and then set your preferred subtitle settings
  5. Select "Save Changes"
