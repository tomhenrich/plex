# Account Settings
You can log into your Plex account on the web to update various settings. I recommend at least updating your language and subtitle settings.

## Privacy and Email Subscriptions

Ethan Sholly has put together a good resource for checking Plex's various privacy-related settings, including marketing email preferences, ad partner data usage, playback data, and more: [Optimal Plex Settings for Privacy-Conscious Users](https://selfh.st/plex-privacy-settings/) [^1]

## Audio & Subtitle Preferences
If you prefer to use subtitles, you can set that option in your account instead of having to select them every time you watch something:

  1. [Log into your account on the web](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/login)
  2. Go to the [Account Settings page](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account) and scroll down to the "Settings" section
  3. **Set your Language preference:**
     1. Next to "LANGUAGE" click "Edit"
     2. Select your preferred language
     3. Click "Save Changes" 
  4. **Set your Audio & Subtitle preferences:**
     1. Next to "AUDIO & SUBTITLE SETTINGS" click "Edit"
     2. Select the checkbox for "Automatically select audio and subtitle tracks"
     3. Set your preferred language for audio and subtitles
     4. Select "Auto-Select Subtitle Mode" to "Always Enabled"
        * "Manually selected" means you will have to select a subtitle every time you watch something.
        * "Shown with foreign audio" means Plex will only display subtitles if you're watching something in a language other than your preferred audio. (e.g. you're watching a Japanese-language movie, so you'll get English subtitles)
     5. The last two boxes are up to you â€” they only apply if something on Plex doesn't already have subtitles and you use its built-in search tool to find some
        * I suggest "Prefer SDH subtitles" (the kind with effects like `[melancholy music]` instead of only dialogue) and "Prefer non-forced subtitles" (forced means foreign dialogue in an otherwise all-English movie)
     6. Select "Save Changes"

You can always change your subtitle selection for any given content while you're watching it.
