# Account Settings
You can log into your Plex account on the web to update various settings. I recommend at least updating your language and subtitle settings.

## Subtitles
If you prefer having subtitles on, you can log into your account and set that preference instead of having to select them every time you watch something:

  1. [Log into your account on the web](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/login)
  2. Go to the [Account Settings page](https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/account) and scroll down to the "Settings" section
  3. Set your language preference:
     1. Next to "LANGUAGE" click "Edit"
     2. Select your preferred language
     3. Click "Save Changes" 
  4. Set your Audio & Subtitle selection preferences:
     1. Next to "AUDIO & SUBTITLE SETTINGS" click "Edit"
     2. Select the checkbox for "Automatically select audio and subtitle tracks"
     3. Set your preferred language for audio and subtitles
     4. Select "Auto-Select Subtitle Mode" to "Always Enabled"
     5. The last two boxes are up to you â€“ they only apply if something on Plex doesn't already have subtitles and you use its built-in search to find some
        * I suggest "Prefer SDH subtitles" (the kind with effects like "[melancholy music]" instead of only dialogue) and "Prefer non-forced subtitles" (forced means foreign dialogue in an otherwise all-English movie)
     6. Select "Save Changes"
