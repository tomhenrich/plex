# How Plex Works

The simple version is: I have a computer at my home that stores media files for movies and TV shows (the "Server"). Plex organizes those files, collects information about them (titles, plot summaries, audience ratings, etc), and streams them to players (called "Clients").

> [!NOTE]
> The company also offers [their own on-demand streaming content](https://watch.plex.tv/on-demand) â€” though this is _completely separate_ from whatever might be hosted by individual server owners.

## Playback
[How well content plays through Plex](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) depends on a few things: the quality settings used by the Client, the internet speed of both the Client and the Server, the format of the video and audio in each file, and the format of any subtitles being used.

ðŸŸ¢ If the Client is _100% compatible_ with every aspect of the source file, it will **Direct Play**, just streaming the file directly as-is.

ðŸŸ¡ If the Client is _mostly compatible_ but just needs a different file type, it will **Direct Stream.**

ðŸŸ  If the Client can't handle something, it will **Transcode** the file to something it _does_ support. This creates some work for the Server since it has to re-create the file on-the-fly, and may result in some buffering.

> [!NOTE]
> This is why it's important to update the quality settings for your device â€” so Plex doesn't have to send you a low-quality transcoded video.

### Common reasons for transcoding:
* If your setup doesn't support 5.1 surround sound, the Server can transcode the audio to a stereo mix.
  * If you're using a streaming device plugged into a TV (like a Roku or Chromecast), it will also depend on what your TV tells the device it can handle.
* If your setup doesn't support the encoding format of the audio or video, the Server will transcode to a format the Client can handle.
* If your setup doesn't support image-based subtitles[^1], the Server has to create a new stream that merges the video and the subtitles together.
  * This is probably the most resource-intensive task the Server has to deal with.
* The network connection speed is not enough to play the original video or audio.
  * The video or audio might have a bitrate (quality level) that is too high for the connection between your device and my Server â€“ either your download speed or my upload speed.
  * Think of it like pushing a ball through a pipe â€“ if the ball is too big for the pipe, you need to squish it down to fit.


[^1]: Physical Blu-rays and DVDs, and files directly copied from them, use subtitles that are just pictures of words which get overlaid on the video.
  These are usually called "PGS" or "Vobsub" when shown in Plex.
