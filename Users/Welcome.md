# Welcome to Plex

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) is a company that makes software letting you host media files and stream that content to devices. Think of it like Netflix, but run by an individual from their own home.

If you're reading this, you were probably invited to my server. Welcome!

## Basic Rules
My Plex server is running from a computer in my home, using my home internet, and has content I've personally added. As such:

* **It's probably not a replacement for your other streaming subscriptions.**
  * I don't have the resources to acquire every movie ever made, but if there's something you'd like me to add, let me know and I'll do what I can to find it (within reason).
* **I cannot 100% guarantee 24/7 availability.**
  * The computer does occasionally need to be restarted for updates, but I try to make sure no one's using it at the time.
* **You may not share your account with others.**

An analogy I particularly like: **my server is like a backyard pool shared with friends.**
* You're welcome to use it whenever you like, just don't let in people I didn't invite.
* Sometimes it might be closed for maintenance or because it's over capacity.
* Yes, I can see if it's being used, but I'm not watching you use it.
* If you continually abuse your access, you don't get to use it anymore.

## Getting Started
1. From the invitation email you received, click the link to **create an account** on the Plex website.
   * Plex will automatically subscribe you to their emails. Visit [plex.tv/email-preferences](https://www.plex.tv/email-preferences/) to unsubscribe.

2. **[Install the Plex app](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/)** on your streaming device of choice and sign in.
   * Plex charges a one-time $5 activation fee on iOS and Android phones[^1], but other devices do not have this restriction.

3. **[Set up your app](https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/)** to remove their default services and pin my stuff to your navigation.
   * The steps are a little different for each device, but the idea is the same everywhere: open the navigation, select "More" to find my libraries and pin them, and do the opposite for their default services.

4. **[Update the quality settings](https://mediaclients.wiki/en/Plex#streaming-clients)** in your app.
   * The default settings in Plex apps are not good and will result in a low-quality experience.

## Actually Using Plex
The **Home Screen** will show what has recently been added to the Server and any titles you're in the middle of watching.

Plex is organized into **Libraries** that can contain either Movies or TV Shows. You can go into a specific Library to browse, or you can use search.

Movies that are part of a series (e.g. all the James Bond movies) are usually grouped into Collections. My Server is set up so any franchise of 2 or more movies goes into a Collection, plus I have some custom collections like "movies based on Stephen King books" or "Chocolate Factory".

Once you decide on something to watch, just click Play. At any time before or during playback, you can change your settings like selecting subtitles, switching audio tracks, or adjusting quality or playback speed.

> [!TIP]
> If you see any ads, you're watching something from Plex's own service. You will never see ads while watching anything from my server.

**Quick note on subtitles:**
* Subtitles labeled "SDH" ("Subtitled for Deaf and Hard of hearing") means they also contain effects like `[music playing]`.
* Subtitles labeled "Forced" means they _only_ contain foreign-language dialogue, like if someone speaks a few lines of French in an otherwise English-language movie.

That's it!
