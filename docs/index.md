# Welcome to Plex
<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex</a> lets people create their own streaming service. I host my collection of movies and TV shows on a computer at home and can play that content anywhere, like my own personal Netflix.

## Getting Started

1. **Accept the Invitation:**  
From the invitation email, click the link to **create a free account** on the official Plex.tv site or sign into your account if you have one.
2. **Get the Plex App:**  
Install the app on your streaming device of choice and sign in.
3. **Update the Quality Settings:** _(optional but important)_  
In the app's Settings menu, look for the "Quality" or "Video" section and [set the quality to "Original" or "Maximum"](quality-settings.md) — otherwise Plex defaults to low-resolution video.
4. **Pin My Server** so you can find stuff:  
This looks a little different on each device, but generally: open the navigation, select "More", <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/#toc-0" target="_blank">pin my libraries for quick access</a>, and unpin Plex's default "Movies & Shows" and "Live TV" links.

That's it! You can start looking for something to watch.

## Quick Reminders

1. **I can't realistically have every movie or show ever made.**
   * Let me know if there's something you'd like to see and I'll try to find it!
   * My goal is to reduce the need for multiple streaming services, but Plex can't fully replace every possible service.
2. **Do not share your account with someone else.**
   * If you think someone would enjoy access, let me know and I can choose whether to invite them. Don't just give them your password.

An analogy I like: **my Plex is like a backyard pool shared with friends.**
* You're welcome to use it whenever you like!
* Sometimes it might be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.
* Yes, I can see if it's being used, just to make sure it's working right.
* Giving your key to someone else will get you kicked out.

If you have any questions or need any help, just ask!

> **NOTE:** I do not control how the app looks or works, I only control what media is available to watch.  
> The actual app itself is owned, maintained, and updated by the company Plex.  
> If a button changes color or something moves around, I can't do anything about that.

## Using Plex
It's very similar to Netflix or other streaming services you've used before.

The _Home Screen_ shows whatever you're currently watching, plus recent additions and new releases.

From the side navigation, pick _Movies_ or _TV Shows_ to browse for something to watch, or use Search. (Search may include results from both my content and Plex's ad-supported streaming service. My content will show as being on `Scylla`.)

**Just click Play** to start watching. You can change your audio or subtitle settings at any time.

Remember, as with any streaming service, **Plex uses your internet.** If you have unlimited data like me, go nuts. If you have a monthly cap, just be mindful.

> **TIP:** You can [update your account settings](account-settings.md) online to enable subtitles without having to select them every time you start watching.

> **NOTE:** If you ever see ads, you're watching something from Plex's own ad-supported service. You will _never_ see ads while watching anything from my server.
