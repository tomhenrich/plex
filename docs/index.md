<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex</a> lets people create their own streaming service. I host my collection of movies and TV shows on a computer at home and can play that content anywhere, like a personal Netflix.

## Get started

1. **Accept the invitation:**  
   From the email, **create a free account** on the Plex.tv site or sign into your account if you have one.
2. **Get the Plex app:**  
   Install the app on your streaming device and sign in.
3. **Update the quality settings:** _(optional but important)_  
   In the app's Settings, look for "Quality" or "Video" and [set the quality to "Original" or "Maximum"](quality-settings.md) — otherwise you'll get low-resolution video.
4. **Pin my server** for quick access:  
   This is a little different on each device, but generally: open the navigation, select "More", and <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/#toc-0" target="_blank">pin my libraries</a>.

That's it! You can start looking for something to watch.

## Quick notes

1. **Do not share your account with someone else outside your home.**  
   Let me know if you think someone would like access. Don't just give them your password.
2. **If there's something you'd like to be added, just ask!**  
   I can't realistically have everything ever made, but I'll do what I can to find it.

If you have any questions or need any help, just ask!

## Using Plex
It's just like Netflix or other streaming services you've used before.

From the side nav, pick _Movies_ or _TV Shows_ to browse, or use Search.  
Search may include results both from my content (shown as being on `Scylla`) and from Plex's ad-supported streaming service.

**Just click Play** to start watching. You can change audio or subtitle settings at any time.

As with any streaming service, **Plex uses your internet.** If you have unlimited data like me, go nuts. If you have a monthly cap, just be mindful.

> **TIP:** You can [update your account settings](account-settings.md) online to enable subtitles without having to select them every time you start watching.

> **NOTE:** If you ever see ads, you're watching something from Plex's own ad-supported service. You will _never_ see ads while watching anything from my server.
