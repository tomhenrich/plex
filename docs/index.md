# Welcome to Plex
<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank">Plex</a> lets people create their own streaming service. I host my collection of movies and TV shows on a computer at home and can play that content anywhere, like my own personal Netflix.

## Getting Started

1. **Accept the Invitation:**  
From the invitation email, click the link to **create a free account** on the official Plex website or sign into your existing account if you have one.
2. **Get the Plex App:**  
Install the app on your streaming device of choice and sign in.
3. **Update the Quality Settings:** _(optional but important)_  
In your app's Settings menu, look for the "Quality" or "Video" section and [set the quality](quality-settings.md) to "Original" or "Maximum", otherwise you're not going to get the best experience.
4. **Pin My Server:**  
This looks a little different on each device, but generally: open the navigation, select "More", find whatever I've shared with you and <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/#toc-0" target="_blank">pin that content for quick access</a>, and unpin Plex's default "Movies & Shows" and "Live TV" links.

That's it! You're in and can start looking for something to watch.

## Basic Intro
My Plex server is running from a computer in my home and has content I've personally curated. As such:

1. **It's not meant to be a full replacement for every possible streaming subscription.**
   * I don't have the resources to acquire every movie ever made, but let me know if there's something you'd like to see and I'll try to find it (within reason).
2. **You may not share your account with anyone else.**

An analogy I like: **my server is like a backyard pool shared with friends.**
* You're welcome to use it whenever you like!
* Sometimes it might be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.
* Yes, I can see if it's being used, just to make sure it's working right.
* Giving your key to someone else will get you kicked out.

If you have any questions or need any help, just ask!

## Using Plex
It's very similar to Netflix or other services you've used before.

The _Home Screen_ shows whatever you're currently watching, plus recent additions and new releases.

From the side navigation, pick _Movies_ or _TV Shows_ to browse for something to watch, or use Search. (Search may include results from both my content and Plex's ad-supported streaming service. My content will show as being on `Scylla`.)

**Just click Play** to start watching. to start watching. You can change your settings at any time.

Remember, as with any streaming service, **Plex uses your internet.** If you have unlimited data like me, go nuts. If you have a monthly cap, just be mindful.

> **TIP:** You can [update your account settings](account-settings.md) online to enable subtitles without having to select them every time you start watching.

> **NOTE:** If you ever see ads, you're watching something from Plex's own ad-supported service. You will _never_ see ads while watching anything from my server.
