# Pinning Media Libraries in Plex

The first time you open Plex on a new device, you will likely see generic streaming options from _Plex the company_ instead of libraries from someone who has invited you to their server. You'll want to remove those and save the libraries you've been invited to.

The steps below may vary slightly by device but should be generally similar.

## Streaming Devices
If you're opening Plex on a TV, Roku, or similar streaming device, once you've signed in:

1. In the left-hand menu, select "More >".
2. Find the library or libraries that were shared with you. They will be listed under my server name, `Scylla`.
3. Select the "..." button and select "Pin".
4. Do the same for any default services from Plex, but select "Unpin" to remove them.
   * Note: Plex's defaults are called "Movies & Shows" and "Live TV"

You should now be able to go back to the Plex home screen and see your pinned libraries.
