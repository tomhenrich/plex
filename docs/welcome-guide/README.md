# Welcome to Plex

[Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) is a company that lets people create their own streaming service. I can host my collection of movies and TV shows on a computer at home and play that content anywhere, like my own personal Netflix.

## Getting Started

1. **Accept the Invitation:**  
From the invitation email, click the link to **create a free account** on the official Plex website or sign into your existing account if you have one.
2. **Get the Plex App:**  
Install the app on your streaming device of choice and sign in.
3. **Update the Quality Settings:** _(optional but important)_  
In your app's Settings menu, look for the "Quality" or "Video" section and [set the quality](/plex/welcome-guide/quality-settings) to "Original" or "Maximum", otherwise you're not going to get the best experience.
4. **Pin My Server**:  
This looks a little different on each device, but generally: open the navigation, select "More", find whatever I've shared with you and [pin that content for quick access](https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-the-apps/#toc-0), and unpin Plex's default "Movies & Shows" and "Live TV" links.

That's it! You're in and can start looking for something to watch.

## Basic Intro
My Plex server is running from a computer in my home and has content I've personally curated. As such:

1. **It's not meant to be a full replacement for every possible streaming subscription.**
   * I don't have the resources to acquire every movie ever made, but let me know if there's something you'd like to see and I'll try to find it (within reason).
2. **You may not share your account with anyone else.**

An analogy I like: **my server is like a backyard pool shared with friends.**
* You're welcome to use it whenever you like!
* Sometimes it might be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.
* Yes, I can see if it's being used, just to make sure it's working right.
* Giving your key to someone else will get you kicked out.

If you have any questions or need any help, just ask!

## Using Plex
It's very similar to Netflix or other services you've seen. The Home Screen shows anything you're in the middle of watching, whatever has recently been added, and new releases.

From the side navigation, pick either Movies or TV Shows to browse for something to watch, or use search if you have something specific in mind. (Search results may include stuff from both my server and Plex's ad-supported streaming service. Content available from me will say it's on `Scylla`.)

**Just click Play** to start watching. You can change your stream settings at any time â€” enable subtitles, adjust quality, switch audio tracks (if there are more than one), etc. Most things should have trailers

Remember, as with any streaming service, **Plex uses your internet.** If you have unlimited data like me, go nuts. If you have a monthly cap, just be mindful.

> [!TIP]
> **Subtitles:** You can [update your account settings](/plex/welcome-guide/account-settings) online to enable subtitles without having to select them every time you start watching.

> [!NOTE]
> If you ever see ads, you're watching something from Plex's own ad-supported service. You will _never_ see ads while watching anything from my server.
