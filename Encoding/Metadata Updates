# Metadata updates after Handbrake completes

Depending on the content of the media and the Handbrake selections, it is encouraged to use MKVToolnixGUI or jMKVPropEdit to update the resulting file to maintain naming and metadata conventions.

## Using MKVToolnixGUI
1. Open MKVToolnixGUI and select the "Header Editor" tab from the navigation.
2. "Segment Information"
    * Set the Title field following Plex's preferred `[Name] (Year)` convention (e.g. `The Matrix (1999)`)
      * If the file is named correctly, use `{file_name}` to have this automatically generated â€“ especially useful if processing more than one file at a time
    * Enable the option to remove tags
3. "Video" track
    * Set the Language field to the original language of the media
4. "Audio" tracks
    * Ensure the Language field of each track is the original language of that audio
    * The first track should have the "Default" attribute set to True
    * Any subsequent tracks should have the "Default" attribute set to False
5. "Subtitle" tracks
    * The first track should have the "Default" attribute set to True
    * Any subsequent tracks should have the "Default" attribute set to False
    * Any SDH tracks should have the "Hearing impaired" attribute set to True
      * Enable the "Extra Parameters" field and enter the following value: `--set flag-hearing-impaired=1`
    * Any Forced tracks should have the "Forced" attribute set to True
