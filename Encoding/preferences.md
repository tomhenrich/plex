# Handbrake Encoding Preferences

## Goals
* Maximize audio/video quality while staying within reasonable file sizes
  * Target file size: under 6 gb per hour of movie duration (e.g. a 2-hour movie should be 12 gb or less)
* Minimize the need for transcoding on moderately-capable client devices
* Do not strain the server's CPU for longer than absolutely necessary

### Assumptions
* x265/HEVC is sufficiently supported to be considered the default codec
* Primary client devices support x265 video and DTS audio
  * If not, the server is sufficiently capable of transcoding these
  * Primary supported client devices:
    * Google TV
    * Roku

## Default Behaviors

### Format and dimensions
* Output to MKV format
* Do not crop video, even to remove black bars â€“ maintain original video dimensions and aspect ratio

### Video
* Encode to `H.265 (x265)` with the framerate set to `Same as source` and `Variable framerate`
* Encoder Preset: `Medium` (typically requires 2-3 hours for an average movie)
  * If possible, set to `Slow` but this usually means 8+ hours to encode an average movie
* Quality Level: set to `18` for most movies
  * Can be set to `20` for older, lower-quality movies
  * Set to `16` for particularly high-profile, visually-impressive movies

### Audio
#### Track selection
* Keep only the original audio
  * Discard dub tracks (if the movie was meant to have Japanese audio, it will be kept in Japanese)
  * Discard any "Audio Description" or Commentary tracks
* Prefer DTS-HD or DTS format, encode to AAC otherwise (do not keep TrueHD, AC3, EAC3, FLAC, or other formats)
  * Passthrough the best-available DTS format when possible (DTS-HD, followed by DTS)
  * Otherwise, convert the highest-quality track to AAC
    * Maintain the highest available channel mix (e.g. if the source is 7.1, keep that intact)
    * Maximum bitrate: 512 kbps or the original track's value, whichever is lower (do not upscale)

#### Track naming
* Label tracks according to their channel availability, not their format:
  * e.g. `Surround 5.1` or `Stereo`, not `DTS Surround` or `AAC for Roku`

### Subtitles
#### Track selection
* Keep only English subtitles
* Keep only subtitles for the actual content of the media
  * Discard Commentary subtitles
  * Discard trivia popups or other non-dialogue tracks
* Check the "Default" checkbox for the primary subtitle track and ensure it is listed first in the track order
* Keep Forced Subtitle tracks when applicable
* Prefer SDH subtitles when available
  * If both SDH and non-SDH are available, keep only SDH
* Keep only image-based subtitles
  * Text-based formats (SRT or SSA/ASS) should be extracted from the source file and stored alongside the output file
* Never burn subtitles into the video

#### Track naming
* Do not include language in the track name (e.g. do not name a track "English")
* SDH tracks should be named "SDH"
* Non-SDH tracks should not have a name
* Forced tracks should be named "Foreign Dialogue"
  * If the media's original language is not English, the subtitle track does not need to be labeled as Forced (e.g. a Japanese movie does not need the English subtitles marked "Forced")

# Metadata updates after Handbrake completes

Depending on the content of the media and the Handbrake selections, it is encouraged to use MKVToolnixGUI or jMKVPropEdit to update the resulting file to maintain naming and metadata conventions.

## Using MKVToolnixGUI
1. Open MKVToolnixGUI and select the "Header Editor" tab from the navigation.
2. "Segment Information"
    * Set the Title field following Plex's preferred `[Name] (Year)` convention (e.g. `The Matrix (1999)`)
3. "Video" track
    * Set the Language field to the original language of the media
4. "Audio" tracks
    * Ensure the Language field of each track is the original language of that audio
    * The first track should have the "Default" attribute set to True
    * Any subsequent tracks should have the "Default" attribute set to False
5. "Subtitle" tracks
    * The first track should have the "Default" attribute set to True
    * Any subsequent tracks should have the "Default" attribute set to False
    * Any SDH tracks should have the "Hearing impaired" attribute set to True
    * Any Forced tracks should have the "Forced" attribute set to True
