# Managing the Plex Server

This section contains general guides to accessing and managing the Plex server.

If you are not interested in maintaining it and just want to decommission it, instructions are available for that. You can keep just the hard drive with the existing media if you still want any of the content.

**Note:** This document does not list passwords. Any passwords will be provided separately.
